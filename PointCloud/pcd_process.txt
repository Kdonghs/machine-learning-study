1.Voxel Grid Down sampling
    -voxel grid: cube in 3d
    -to deal with it efficiently
    -If you use the original data as it is, there is a lot of information,
    but it takes too much time to process the data.
    -A method of keeping only one point inside the Voxel Grid and filtering the rest to remove it
    -voxel_size use 0.1m, 0.2m etc
    -ROI (Region Of Interest): How to downsampling based on area

2.use to RANSAC from object, road classifications
    -It is a simple and effective algorithm that distinguishes inliers from outliers.
